	<!-- Objectives of the Personal Profile Webpage
	The goal of this project is to create a simple personal profile webpage using only HTML. This exercise will test the ability to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements effectively.
	
	Objectives:
	Create a Header Section:
	
	Display the page title (e.g., "My Profile").
	Add a navigation menu with at least three items (e.g., "About Me," "Hobbies," "Contact").
	Add a Bio Section:
	
	Provide a short biography introducing the person.
	Include an image (either a real photo or a placeholder).
	List Hobbies or Interests:
	
	Display a list (<ul> or <ol>) of at least three hobbies or interests.
	Add a Footer Section:
	
	Include contact details such as an email address or social media handle.
	Use Cases of the Personal Profile Webpage
	Personal Branding:
	
	Acts as an online resume or digital introduction.
	Helps individuals showcase their interests and background.
	Learning HTML Structure:
	
	Assists beginners in understanding semantic HTML.
	Provides practice in creating structured content without CSS or JavaScript.
	Portfolio Showcase:
	
	Can serve as a starting point for a professional portfolio.
	Allows users to expand with more sections in the future.
	Networking & Contact Information:
	
	Enables easy sharing of contact details with others.
	Can be used as a simple landing page for personal use. -->
